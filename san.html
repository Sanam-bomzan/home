<h1>Welcome to my text page practice page</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> This page is a demonstration of the text tags I have learned in HTML.</p>

<h3> Formatting Examples</h3>
<p><strong>Strong</strong> text is used to highlight important things.</p>
<p><em>Emphasized </em> text adds stress or importance in a sentence.</p>
<p><b>Bold</b> text is also used for emphasis.</p>
<p><i>Italic</i> text is often for quotes or titles.</p>
<p><u>Underline</u> text is rare in modern web design but still useful.</p>

<h4>Breaks and lines</h4>
<p> This is a paragraph with a line break <br>right here in the middle.</p>
<hr>
<p>The horizontal line above separates the section of content.</p>

<h5>Quotation Tags</h5>
<blockquote> This is a block quote. It is often used to display longer quotations from another source.
</blockquote>
